**Pushing events**
Currently, the leading player is performing an action (client-side), then pushing an event to the server, which will have to be received and reproduced by other connections (and not repeated by the leading player).
This could be changed to the leading player first pushing the event to the server, then all connections can perform the event on their own client (leading player included) and therefore everything will synchronise better.
