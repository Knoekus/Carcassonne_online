**Ideas**
Pushing events to feed
	(1) Push to a game event list, assigning a list to the event with a slot for each player. 
		Once a player has carried out the event, they set their slot to 1.
		Once all slots are set to 1, the event gets removed and the next event (if available) is performed.
	(2) Push to a player event list, giving each player a separate list.
		Once a player has carried out the event, they remove it from their own list immediately and move on to the next.
		
	(Summary) 1 might store the data more efficiently, saving database storage space.
		1 might be difficult to perform smoothly since everyone has to wait for the slowest client.
		2 might be better for synchronisation, since each client can work at their own pace.
	(Choice) Probably going to try option 2, then see if data storage in the database becomes a problem.
